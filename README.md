Screen Agnostic Pen Calibrate is a batch script to automate calibrating pen input with tabcal independent of screen resolution. Currently supports 70 calibration points in a 10x7 grid.

WARNING: Wacom drivers might interfer with Window's native tabcal, either use Wacom's calibration software or uninstall, restart, and run the script to use tabcal.
